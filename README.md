# road-accident-analysis
This  road accident data in Harrow, focusing on data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, and clustering analysis

Analysis Techniques
Descriptive Statistics: Summary metrics for numerical and categorical variables.
Clustering Analysis: K-means clustering on accident severity and seasonal data.
Correlation Analysis: Heatmap to identify relationships between features.
Predictive Modeling: Decision Tree for accident severity classification.


Tools & Libraries
The project uses Python and several key libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation
NumPy: Numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Clustering (K-means) and predictive modeling (Decision Tree)
Google Colab: Project development environment


Key Findings
Accident Hotspots: Most accidents occur at single carriageways and “Give Way” junctions.
Seasonal Trends: Higher accident rates are observed in summer due to increased traffic activity.
Accident Severity: Minor accidents dominate, but Fatal and Serious cases reveal key risk patterns.
Weather Conditions: Clear weather and dry roads are prevalent during most accidents.

How to Run the Project?
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/road-accident-analysis.git

Open in Google Colab:

Upload the *.ipynb file in your Colab environment.
Ensure the required libraries (e.g., Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) are installed.

Run the Notebook:

Execute cells sequentially to preprocess data, generate visualizations, and train the model.
